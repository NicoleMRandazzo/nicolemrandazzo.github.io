    &emsp;The objective of this project was to identify a physical object with a design flaw and propose a tangible modification to better meet user needs. Our team of three chose the folding tables for lecture chairs - commonly found in auditorium-style classrooms -  as our focus. The primary users and/or customers of this object are college students and educational institutions that utilize fixed seating. Drawing from our experience at UT Austin and conversations with fellow students, we pinpointed several recurring frustrations with these tables.

    &emsp;Our team of four collected a clay-rich soil sample from the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in Austin, TX, two days after a major rain event. Notably, the site where we collected our soil underwent a prescribed burn several months prior, potentially influencing microbial diversity. To begin our research, we performed serial dilutions to isolate distinct bacterial colonies, ultimately selecting 54 colonies for further analysis (pictured above). After analyzing their morphology and co-culturing them with Escherichia coli and Enterococcus raffinosus to screen for antibiotic production, we isolated four colonies. Three of these colonies had a zone of inhibition that indicated antimicrobial activity, while the last one had a unique morphology (a pink pigmentation).

  &emsp;To deepen our characterization, we conducted Gram staining and observed the bacteria under a microscope (left image). We also performed a suite of biochemical tests, including catalase, oxidase, motility, MacConkey Agar, and hemolysis tests. In the hemolysis test (right image), one isolate demonstrated Beta hemolysis, evidenced by a clear zone indicating red blood cell breakdown. After presenting our findings to the class, we submitted our data to the Tiny Earth Project, contributing to the broader effort to discover antibiotics effective against ESKAPE Pathogens. The genetic sequences of Isolate 1, 2, and 3 may be analyzed further for novel antibiotic compounds or cross-referenced with existing entries in the Tiny Earth database.
