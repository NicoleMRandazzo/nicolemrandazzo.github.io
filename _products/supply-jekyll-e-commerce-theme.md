&emsp;The objective of this project was to identify a physical object with a design flaw and propose a tangible modification to better meet user needs. Our team of three chose the folding tables for lecture chairs - commonly found in auditorium-style classrooms -  as our focus. The primary users and/or customers of this object are college students and educational institutions that utilize fixed seating. Drawing from our experience at UT Austin and conversations with fellow students, we pinpointed several recurring frustrations with these tables.

&emsp;To begin this project, we identified a common lecture table on campus and modeled it in Fusion 360 (pictured above). One of the major problems with this object was its limited surface area, which often failed to accommodate notebooks, laptops, and other essential materials. This constraint not only disrupted focus during lectures but also heightened stress during exams, as students struggled to balance items on their laps or risk dropping them. Additional concerns included stability, mobility, thickness, cost, aesthetics, durability, functionality, and compatibility with existing lecture chairs.

&emsp;Our redesigned desk, pictured above, prioritizes usability and adaptability. Inspired by existing lecture tables and airplane trays, we incorporated several enhancements. First, we added hinges to the center of our desk to allow the user to choose their preferred working area. When the desk is folded, it is around 7 inches long and 4.5 inches wide, leaving the extended version to be around 14 inches long and 4.5 inches wide. Second, we added a dual-axis hinge that enables desk movement along both the x and y axes. This allows the user to easily enter or exit their seat without disrupting their items on the desk. Lastly, we included an integrated pencil groove, preventing writing utensils from rolling off the flat surface. With these modifications, we aimed to improve comfort, reduce stress, and enhance the classroom experience of students.
